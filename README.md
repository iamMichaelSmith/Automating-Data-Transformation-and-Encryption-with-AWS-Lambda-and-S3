    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This project showcases a sophisticated AWS-based data processing workflow that automates the conversion of raw text files into structured CSV files. Leveraging services such as AWS Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, and SNS, the system retrieves, cleans, and transforms data, then stores it in DynamoDB and sends notifications upon successful processing. The solution highlights efficient integration and scalability of AWS services to manage and notify data operations.
